<h3>Topic</h3>
Quantum Compiler : extensions and optimisations

<h4>Project description</h4>
The OpenQL programming language was developed for the Intel collaboration but the compiler has been changed to produce perfect qubits. The back-end of the compiler generates cQASM 2.0 and we need to extend it to cQASM 3.0. The person working on this project will do that in the context of a PhD thesis and is supposed to execute a lot of quantum circuits on the QBeeSim simulator in combination with the current version of the micro-architecture to have a solid testing of the compiler.

<h4>Qualifications</h4>
We seek a candidate with experience of programming in C++ as well as an introductory knowledge of gate-based quantum computation. Familarity with compilation framework will be a plus. For M.Sc. thesis, the candidate must be enrolled in a masters program. 

<h4>Location</h4>
QBee.eu office at Leuven, Belgium. Remote working can be considered based on Covid situation.

<h4>Position role</h4>
M.Sc. thesis or Internship for a 6-12 months duration. Possibility of Ph.D. position and job offer in QBee.eu based on performance and funding.

<h4>Application procedure and deadline</h4>
Please send a CV and a motivation letter to koen.bertels@qbee.eu or admin@qbee.eu by July 15, 2021.
