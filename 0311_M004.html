<h3>Topic</h3>
To develop, test and extend the QBeeSim simulator

<h4>Project description</h4>
Any generic micro-architecture that QBee.eu will develop will be connected to the QBeeSim simulator. This simulator is a powerful and scalable simulator. However, for many applications, we will need a number of qubits much higher than we currently can generate and use. To this purpose, we need to run the simulator on very powerful servers, where memories the size of ZetaBytes will be needed. The QBeeSim simulator will have to be changed such that large number of qubits is possible. The target number of qubits we will need is estimated to be around 100 in superpostion or full-entangled.

<h4>Qualifications</h4>
We seek a candidate with experience of programming in C++ and OpenCL (or CUDA) as well as an introductory knowledge of gate-based quantum computation. For M.Sc. thesis, the candidate must be enrolled in a masters program. 

<h4>Location</h4>
QBee.eu office at Leuven, Belgium. Remote working can be considered based on Covid situation.

<h4>Position role</h4>
M.Sc. thesis or Internship for a 6-12 months duration. Possibility of Ph.D. position and job offer in QBee.eu based on performance and funding.

<h4>Application procedure and deadline</h4>
Please send a CV and a motivation letter to koen.bertels@qbee.eu or admin@qbee.eu by July 15, 2021.
