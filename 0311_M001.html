<h3>Topic</h3>
Efficient quantum computing simulator based on general tensor network.

<h4>Project description</h4>
Quantum computing simulators allow development and testing of quantum algorithms on classical systems. While it is difficult to scale to a high number of qubits, it is nevertheless possible to go upto 100 qubits for specific use cases, using smart linear algebra tricks, hardware accelerators and super-computing clusters. In this thesis, the candidate is expected to explore and implement an efficient quantum computing simulator. The Schrodinger-Feynman method using tensor networks on GPUs needs to be explored and contrasted with a full state vector simulation (Schrodinger method) and a density matrix simulation.

<h4>Qualifications</h4>
We seek a candidate with experience of programming in C++ and OpenCL (or CUDA) as well as an introductory knowledge of gate-based quantum computation. Understanding of tensor networks for many-body physics simulation is a plus. For M.Sc. thesis, the candidate must be enrolled in a masters program. 

<h4>Location</h4>
QBee.eu office at Leuven, Belgium. Remote working can be considered based on Covid situation.

<h4>Position role</h4>
M.Sc. thesis or Internship for a 6-12 months duration. Possibility of Ph.D. position and job offer in QBee.eu based on performance and funding.

<h4>Application procedure and deadline</h4>
Please send a CV and a motivation letter to \textbf{koen.bertels@qbee.eu} or \textbf{admin@qbee.eu} by July 15, 2021.
