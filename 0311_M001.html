<h4>Topic</h4>
Efficient quantum computing simulator based on general tensor network.

<h5>Project description</h5>
Quantum computing simulators allow development and testing of quantum algorithms on classical systems. While it is difficult to scale to a high number of qubits, it is nevertheless possible to go upto 100 qubits for specific use cases, using smart linear algebra tricks, hardware accelerators and super-computing clusters. In this thesis, the candidate is expected to explore and implement an efficient quantum computing simulator. The Schrodinger-Feynman method using tensor networks on GPUs needs to be explored and contrasted with a full state vector simulation (Schrodinger method) and a density matrix simulation.

<h5>Qualifications</h5>
We seek a candidate with experience of programming in C++ and OpenCL (or CUDA) as well as an introductory knowledge of gate-based quantum computation. Understanding of tensor networks for many-body physics simulation is a plus. For M.Sc. thesis, the candidate must be enrolled in a masters program. 

<h5>Location</h5>
QBee.eu office at Leuven, Belgium. Remote working can be considered based on Covid situation.
